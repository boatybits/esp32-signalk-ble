# MicroPython Library Requirements

## Core Dependencies
These libraries are built into MicroPython firmware:
- `bluetooth` - BLE functionality
- `machine` - Hardware access (Pin, I2C, etc.)
- `struct` - Binary data packing
- `time` - Time functions
- `gc` - Garbage collection

## Optional Sensor Libraries
Install these if using real sensors:

### BME280 (Temperature, Humidity, Pressure)
```python
# Via mip (MicroPython package manager):
import mip
mip.install("bme280")
```

### DS18B20 (Temperature)
```python
# Via mip:
import mip
mip.install("onewire")
mip.install("ds18x20")
```

## Installation Notes
1. These libraries should be uploaded to the ESP32's `/lib` directory
2. Use Thonny IDE or `ampy` to upload files
3. Ensure MicroPython firmware is v1.20 or later for best BLE support

## Manual Installation (if needed)
If mip is not available, download libraries from:
- https://github.com/micropython/micropython-lib
- Place .py files in the `lib/` directory on ESP32
